## 📋 Tables Content

The telecom dataset contains a rich set of information related to the telecommunications industry. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the columns:

- **Area**: This column specifies the geographical area covered by the telecom data, which may include regions, districts, or service zones.

- **Shared Region**: Shared regions refer to areas where multiple telecom providers share the same infrastructure. This column helps identify areas with collaborative network setups.

- **LTE Accessibility**: LTE (Long-Term Evolution) accessibility measures the availability and reach of 4G networks, indicating the extent to which users can connect to high-speed mobile internet.

- **LTE Retainability**: LTE retainability measures the ability of LTE networks to maintain connections without frequent disconnections or drops.

- **LTE Intra Frequency Handover**: This column provides insights into the handover processes within the same LTE frequency band, crucial for seamless connectivity during mobile device movement.

- **LTE Inter Frequency Handover**: Inter-frequency handovers involve switching between different LTE frequency bands, allowing devices to maintain network connections even when transitioning between coverage areas.

- **4G VoLTE Accessibility**: VoLTE (Voice over LTE) accessibility measures the availability of 4G networks capable of supporting high-quality voice calls.

- **Volte CSSR**: VoLTE Call Setup Success Rate (CSSR) indicates the effectiveness of establishing voice calls over LTE networks.

- **Network Availability**: Network availability records the uptime and downtime of the telecom network, providing insights into the overall reliability of services.

- **Time Value**: This column contains timestamps or time-related data, allowing for temporal analysis and trend identification.

- **Country**: The country column specifies the country where the data was collected, helping users categorize and filter data by geographical location.

- **City**: City information provides additional granularity, allowing users to drill down into specific urban areas or regions.

- **State**: The state or province column offers insights into the administrative divisions within a country, aiding in regional analysis.

- **Postal Code**: Postal codes or zip codes help narrow down data to specific postal regions, facilitating detailed geographic analyses.

- **Region**: The region column may contain additional information about the telecom service area or a subregion within a city or state.
